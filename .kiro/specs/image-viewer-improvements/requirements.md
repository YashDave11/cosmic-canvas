# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the Cosmic Canvas image viewer experience. The improvements focus on creating a dedicated viewer page, modernizing the viewer controls, and adding annotation capabilities to enhance user interaction with astronomical images.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dedicated Image Viewer Page

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view images on a dedicated page, so that I can have an immersive full-screen experience without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an image in the dashboard THEN the system SHALL navigate to a new dedicated viewer page
2. WHEN the viewer page loads THEN the system SHALL display the selected image in full-screen mode
3. WHEN the viewer page loads THEN the system SHALL pass the image metadata (dziUrl, name) via URL parameters or route params
4. WHEN a user is on the viewer page THEN the system SHALL provide a way to return to the dashboard
5. IF the viewer page is accessed without valid image data THEN the system SHALL redirect to the dashboard with an error message

### Requirement 2: Modern Styled Viewer Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want modern and intuitive viewer controls, so that I can easily navigate and manipulate the image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewer page loads THEN the system SHALL display modern styled controls for zoom in, zoom out, rotate, and reset
2. WHEN controls are displayed THEN the system SHALL use a consistent design system with proper spacing, colors, and hover effects
3. WHEN a user hovers over a control button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (hover state)
4. WHEN a user clicks a control button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (active state)
5. WHEN controls are displayed THEN the system SHALL include tooltips explaining each control's function
6. WHEN the viewer is in use THEN the system SHALL position controls in an accessible location that doesn't obstruct the image
7. WHEN controls are rendered THEN the system SHALL use modern UI patterns (glass morphism, smooth transitions, proper iconography)
8. WHEN the page is responsive THEN the system SHALL adapt control layout for mobile and tablet devices

### Requirement 3: Annotation System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add annotations to images, so that I can mark and document interesting features in astronomical images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user double-clicks on the image THEN the system SHALL create a new annotation pin at that location
2. WHEN an annotation pin is created THEN the system SHALL display a visual marker (pin/dot) at the clicked coordinates
3. WHEN a user clicks on an annotation pin THEN the system SHALL display a popup/modal to add or edit annotation text
4. WHEN a user saves annotation text THEN the system SHALL store the annotation with its coordinates and text
5. WHEN a user returns to the same image THEN the system SHALL display all previously created annotations
6. WHEN a user hovers over an annotation pin THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the annotation text
7. WHEN a user wants to delete an annotation THEN the system SHALL provide a delete button in the annotation popup
8. WHEN annotations are displayed THEN the system SHALL scale properly with zoom level changes
9. WHEN multiple annotations exist THEN the system SHALL display them all without overlap issues
10. IF the user navigates away THEN the system SHALL persist annotations in local storage or state management
11. WHEN the annotation popup is open THEN the system SHALL provide a modern styled input field and save/cancel buttons
12. WHEN annotations are rendered THEN the system SHALL use distinct visual styling to differentiate from viewer controls

### Requirement 4: Enhanced User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth transitions and loading states, so that the application feels polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL provide smooth page transitions
2. WHEN an image is loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
3. WHEN controls are interacted with THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations
4. WHEN annotations are added or removed THEN the system SHALL animate the changes
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the viewer to work properly, so that I can explore images regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewer is accessed on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly controls
2. WHEN the viewer is accessed on tablet THEN the system SHALL optimize layout for medium screens
3. WHEN the viewer is accessed on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize available screen space effectively
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support keyboard shortcuts for common actions
5. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
