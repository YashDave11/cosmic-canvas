## Common Workflows

### Scientific Documentation

1. Right-click on features of interest
2. Name them scientifically (e.g., "HII region candidate")
3. Add coordinates and details
4. Export list for reference

### Educational Tour

1. Create annotations for key features
2. Name them clearly for students
3. Use list to navigate during presentation
4. Students can follow along

### Personal Exploration

1. Mark anything interesting
2. Add personal notes
3. Come back later to review
4. Share discoveries with others

## Troubleshooting

### Right-click shows browser menu?

- The app should prevent this
- If it happens, try clicking the image area
- Refresh the page if needed

### Annotation not saving?

- Check localStorage is enabled
- Not in private/incognito mode

‚úÖ Use descriptive names
‚úÖ Create annotations as you explore
‚úÖ Review and edit for clarity

### Don'ts

‚ùå Don't use generic names like "Point 1"
‚ùå Don't create too many overlapping annotations
‚ùå Don't forget to save after editing
‚ùå Don't delete without confirming

## Examples

### Good Annotation Names

- "Spiral arm with dust lanes"
- "Bright star cluster - possible globular"
- "Dark nebula region"
- "Galaxy core - active nucleus"
- "Supernova remnant candidate"

### Poor Annotation Names

- "Thing"
- "Here"
- "Point 1"
- "Interesting"
- "Look at this"

## Advanced Usage

### Coordinate Reference

- Annotations show X%, Y% coordinates
- Use for precise location reference
- Share coordinates with others
- Document exact positions

### Batch Operations

- Create multiple annotations quickly
- Review all in list
- Edit names in sequence
- Delete unwanted ones

### Export/Import

- Future feature: Export as JSON
- Share annotation sets
- Import from others
- Backup your work
