## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "git: command not found"

Install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### "GitHub authentication failed"

Use GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

### "Vercel build failed"

Check the error log - usually a missing dependency:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Fix errors, then push again.
