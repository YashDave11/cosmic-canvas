## 🆘 What If I Can't Wait Overnight?

### Option 1: Deploy Now, Upload During Day

- Deploy now (5 min)
- Start upload now
- Check back in 2-4 hours
- Update when done

### Option 2: Use Faster Internet

- Go to a friend's house with faster internet
- Use office/school internet
- Use mobile hotspot (if faster)

### Option 3: Upload Fewer Images

- Upload just 2-3 images first (30 min)
- Add more later

### Option 4: Reduce Tile Quality

- Regenerate tiles at lower quality
- Smaller files = faster upload
- Still looks great!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Make Upload Faster:

```bash
# Use more parallel transfers
rclone sync E:\NASA_TILES\ r2:cosmic-canvas-tiles/ \
  --progress \
  --transfers 16 \
  --checkers 32
```

### Keep Computer Awake:

- Windows: Settings → Power → Never sleep
- Or use: `powercfg /change standby-timeout-ac 0`

### Monitor Upload:

- Rclone shows progress
- Check Cloudflare dashboard
- Verify files are uploading

**The app works perfectly with 1 image!**
