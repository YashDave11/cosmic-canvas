# üîß Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot initialize: viewerRef or OpenSeadragon not available"

**Cause:** The viewer is trying to initialize before the DOM element is ready or before OpenSeadragon script loads.

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Fixed! The viewer now waits for both the ref and OpenSeadragon to be ready.

**What was changed:**

- Added retry logic to wait for viewerRef
- Added better logging to track initialization
- Improved error handling

### Issue: Viewer page shows blank screen

**Possible Causes:**

1. Missing DZI URL in navigation
2. DZI file doesn't exist
3. OpenSeadragon failed to load

**Solutions:**

1. **Check URL parameters:**

   - URL should look like: `/viewer/image-id?dziUrl=/tiles/image.dzi&name=Image%20Name`
   - Make sure `dziUrl` parameter is present

2. **Verify DZI file exists:**

   - Check that the file exists at the path specified in `dziUrl`
   - For local files: `public/tiles/your-image.dzi`

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Look for error messages
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

---

### Issue: Annotations not saving

**Possible Causes:**

1. localStorage is disabled
2. Browser in private/incognito mode
3. Storage quota exceeded

**Solutions:**

1. **Check localStorage:**

   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.getItem("cosmic-canvas-annotations");
   ```

2. **Clear old data:**

   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.removeItem("cosmic-canvas-annotations");
   ```

3. **Check browser settings:**
   - Ensure cookies/storage is enabled
   - Exit private/incognito mode

---

### Issue: Control panel not showing

**Possible Causes:**

1. Viewer not initialized
2. CSS not loaded
3. Z-index conflict

**Solutions:**

1. **Check viewer state:**

   - Look for loading indicator
   - Check console for errors

2. **Verify viewer initialized:**

   - Control panel only shows after viewer loads
   - Wait for "‚úÖ Image loaded successfully" in console

3. **Check CSS:**
   - Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

---

### Issue: Images not loading from AWS

**Possible Causes:**

1. Incorrect CloudFront URL
2. CORS issues
3. Files not uploaded

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify CloudFront URL:**

   ```typescript
   // In tile-image-search.tsx, check:
   dziUrl: "https://YOUR-DOMAIN.cloudfront.net/tiles/image.dzi";
   ```

2. **Test URL directly:**

   - Open CloudFront URL in browser
   - Should see XML content
   - If 403: Check S3 bucket policy
   - If 404: Check file path

3. **Check S3 upload:**
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket/tiles/ --recursive
   ```

### Issue: Keyboard shortcuts not working

**Possible Causes:**

1. Focus not on viewer
2. Input field is focused
3. Browser shortcuts conflict

**Solutions:**

1. **Click on viewer area first**

   - Keyboard shortcuts need focus

2. **Close annotation popup**

   - Press Escape to close popup
   - Then try shortcuts

3. **Check browser shortcuts:**
   - Some browsers override certain keys
   - Try different keys

---

### Issue: Annotations appear in wrong location

**Possible Causes:**

1. Coordinate calculation issue
2. Zoom level changed
3. Image rotated

**Solutions:**

1. **Reset view:**

   - Click Home button (or press 0)
   - Try creating annotation again

2. **Refresh page:**

   - Annotations should persist
   - Positions should be correct

3. **Clear and recreate:**
   - Delete problematic annotation
   - Create new one

---

### Issue: Mobile controls not working

**Possible Causes:**

1. Touch events not registered
2. Viewport too small
3. CSS not responsive

**Solutions:**

1. **Use touch gestures:**

   - Pinch to zoom
   - Drag to pan
   - Double-tap to create annotation

2. **Rotate device:**

   - Landscape mode gives more space
   - Controls adapt to orientation

3. **Check viewport:**
   - Ensure device width > 320px
   - Zoom out browser if needed

---

### Issue: Performance is slow

**Possible Causes:**

1. Too many annotations
2. Large tile files
3. Slow network

**Solutions:**

1. **Reduce annotations:**

   - Delete unused annotations
   - Keep under 100 per image

2. **Optimize tiles:**

   - Use appropriate tile size (256x256)
   - Compress images before tiling
   - Use JPEG for photos

3. **Check network:**
   - Use CloudFront for faster delivery
   - Check Network tab in DevTools
   - Look for slow requests

## Debug Mode

### Enable Verbose Logging

Add this to your browser console:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("debug", "cosmic-canvas:*");
```

### Check Viewer State

```javascript
// In browser console while on viewer page:
console.log("Viewer:", window.viewer);
console.log("Annotations:", localStorage.getItem("cosmic-canvas-annotations"));
```

### Test OpenSeadragon

```javascript
// Check if OpenSeadragon is loaded:
console.log("OpenSeadragon:", window.OpenSeadragon);
```

## Browser Console Messages

### Good Messages (Everything Working)

```
üì• Loading OpenSeadragon script...
‚úÖ OpenSeadragon script loaded
üöÄ Initializing OpenSeadragon with DZI: /tiles/image.dzi
‚úÖ Image loaded successfully
üìå Added annotation: {...}
‚úÖ Annotation updated
```

### Warning Messages (Check These)

```
‚è≥ Waiting for viewerRef...
‚è≥ OpenSeadragon script loading...
```

These are normal during initialization but shouldn't persist.

### Error Messages (Need Fixing)

```
‚ùå viewerRef is not available
‚ùå OpenSeadragon is not loaded
‚ùå Failed to load image
‚ùå Failed to load OpenSeadragon script
```

These indicate problems that need to be fixed.
