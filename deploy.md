# ðŸš€ Quick Deploy Guide

## The Absolute Simplest Way to Deploy

### Step 1: Upload Tiles (Choose ONE method)

#### Method A: Cloudflare Dashboard (Easiest, No Setup)

1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Sign up (free)
3. Go to R2 â†’ Create bucket â†’ Name it `cosmic-canvas-tiles`
4. Click "Upload" button
5. Drag and drop your `E:\NASA_TILES\` folder contents
6. Wait for upload (grab a coffee â˜•)
7. Go to Settings â†’ Enable "Public Access"
8. Copy the public URL (looks like: `https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev`)

#### Method B: Rclone (Faster for large files)

```bash
# 1. Download rclone: https://rclone.org/downloads/
# 2. Run this:
rclone config
# Choose: Cloudflare R2
# Name: r2
# Enter your Cloudflare credentials

# 3. Upload:
rclone sync E:\NASA_TILES\ r2:cosmic-canvas-tiles/ --progress
```

### Step 2: Update Your Code

Create a file named `.env.local` in your project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_TILES_BASE_URL=https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev
```

(Replace with YOUR R2 public URL from Step 1)

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Using Vercel Website (Easiest)

1. Push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Ready to deploy"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cosmic-canvas.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. Go to https://vercel.com/
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repo
5. Add environment variable:
   - Name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_TILES_BASE_URL`
   - Value: Your R2 URL
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Wait 2 minutes
8. Done! ðŸŽ‰

#### Option B: Using Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Test Your Deployment

1. Open your Vercel URL (e.g., `cosmic-canvas.vercel.app`)
2. Check if images load
3. Test zoom and pan
4. Try creating annotations
5. Test PDF export

## âœ… That's It!

Your Cosmic Canvas is now live and accessible worldwide!

**Total Time**: 2-5 hours (mostly waiting for upload)
**Total Cost**: $0

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Images not showing?

- Check R2 public URL is correct in `.env.local`
- Verify bucket has public access enabled
- Check Vercel environment variables

### Upload taking forever?

- Use rclone instead of dashboard
- Check your internet speed
- Upload during off-peak hours

### Deployment failed?

- Run `npm run build` locally first
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify all dependencies installed
